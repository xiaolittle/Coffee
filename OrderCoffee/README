index.html
login.html
menu.html
menudetail.html
contact.html

The main page is index.html. Only sign in, menu, shop can be clicked currently.
We will add other functions later.

Tasks:
1.HTML, CSS, LESS.
Both of us spent 2 days to finish current pages.We need to add more for contact.html, menudetail.html and We need to add map and order pages too.
2. Ember.js
Add js later.. To interact with parse.
3. Parse
Still learing the example. This one would take most of our time to figure out how to store data.
4. Git. Several hours


Questions:
We are not familiar with Parse.Still learing the example given in the website. 
It looks like parse has different application for ios, android, javascript.
So we should use the guide for javascript? 
And about the "Parse Push". We might use this function to store our data.
